### ðŸ“Š Data Structures Overview

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can efficiently perform various operations such as searching, sorting, and updating. They are essential for optimizing algorithms and managing data effectively in applications.

Examples include Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs. Among these, Linked Lists are particularly important for dynamic memory usage.

### Key Features of Data Structures in Java

**Predefined and Custom Implementations:**
- Java provides built-in data structures (e.g., Arrays, Lists, Maps) in the Java Collections Framework
- Custom data structures can be implemented using classes and objects

**Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
- Some structures like Lists and Maps can grow or shrink dynamically, making them more flexible than fixed-size arrays

**Generics Support:**
- Data structures in Java are type-safe, allowing developers to specify the type of elements stored, reducing runtime errors

**Thread-Safe Options:**
- Java provides concurrent data structures (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) for multi-threaded environments

### Types of Data Structures in Java

#### Linear Data Structures:
- **Array**: A fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations
- **Linked List**: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node
- **Stack**: A LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure for managing elements
- **Queue**: A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure, often used in scheduling tasks

#### Hierarchical Data Structures:
- **Tree**: A collection of nodes organized in a hierarchy, starting from a root node
- **Binary Tree**: A tree where each node has at most two children
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree with nodes organized for quick searches
- **Heap**: A special tree-based structure for priority-based tasks

#### Graph:
- A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges where relationships are represented
- Can be directed or undirected

#### Hash-Based Data Structures:
- **HashMap**: Stores key-value pairs for efficient retrieval
- **HashSet**: Stores unique elements for quick membership checks

#### Advanced Data Structures:
- **Trie**: Used for prefix-based searching
- **Segment Tree**: Used for range queries
- **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree
