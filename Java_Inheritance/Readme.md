## ðŸ§¬ Java Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. In Java, inheritance allows a new class (subclass/child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class (superclass/parent class).

### Key Concepts

- **Superclass (Parent class)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class
- **Subclass (Child class)**: The class that inherits from another class. A subclass can add its own properties and methods, as well as override or extend the behavior of methods from the superclass

### Types of Inheritance in Java

Java supports single inheritance, meaning a subclass can inherit from only one superclass. However, it can still implement multiple interfaces.

#### 1. Single Inheritance

A class inherits from one superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Animal is eating
Dog is barking
```

#### 2. Multilevel Inheritance

A subclass can also serve as a superclass for another subclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Puppy is playing");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Puppy puppy = new Puppy();
        puppy.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        puppy.bark(); // Inherited from Dog
        puppy.play(); // Defined in Puppy
    }
}
```

#### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple classes can inherit from a single superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cat is meowing");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog

        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        cat.meow(); // Defined in Cat
    }
}
```

### Key Features of Inheritance

- **Reusability**: Code from the parent class can be reused in the child class
- **Method Overriding**: A subclass can modify or "override" the behavior of a method defined in the parent class
- **Access to Parent Class Members**: A subclass can access the public and protected members of the parent class, but not private members

### Method Overriding

Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method signature (name, return type, parameters) must be the same.

**Syntax:**
```java
@Override
return_type method_name(parameters) {
    // new implementation
}
```

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Animal();
        animal.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks

        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.sound(); // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

**Important Notes on Method Overriding:**
- `@Override` annotation is optional but helps the compiler check for errors
- The overridden method in the subclass should have the same access level or be more permissive than the method in the superclass

### Constructor Inheritance

Constructors are not inherited by the child class. However, the child class can call the constructor of the parent class using `super()`.

- If the parent class has a no-argument constructor, the subclass can call it implicitly
- If the parent class has a parameterized constructor, the subclass must explicitly call it using `super()`

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal constructor");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super(); // Calling the parent class constructor
        System.out.println("Dog constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Animal constructor
Dog constructor
```

### Polymorphism and Inheritance

Polymorphism in Java is closely tied to inheritance. When a subclass object is referred to by a superclass reference, the method invoked is based on the actual object type (dynamic method dispatch).

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        
        myAnimal.sound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.sound();    // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

### Access Modifiers and Inheritance

Access modifiers determine the visibility of members (fields and methods) across classes:

- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package or by subclasses
- **Default** (no modifier): Accessible within the same package
- **Private**: Not accessible outside the class

**Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    public String name; // Can be accessed from anywhere
    protected int age;   // Can be accessed by subclasses or within the same package
    private String breed; // Only accessible within the Animal class
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);  // Public field, accessible
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);    // Protected field, accessible
        // System.out.println("Breed: " + breed); // Error: breed is private
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.printDetails();
    }
}
```
